# The Planetary Scale Computer

This is a self-describing planetary scale computer. The [book](https://p.jjm.net) is served by the very systems it describes — a constellation of microservices handling discovery, routing, configuration, caching, storage, and monitoring, all built from scratch in Rust and running right now.

Read the chapters to understand how they work. Run the code to see them in action.

## Running

Install [Rust](https://rustup.rs), then:

```
./start.sh
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080). Press `Ctrl-C` to stop everything.
